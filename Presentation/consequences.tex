  What do we know about \(L\)?

  \begin{theorem}
    If \(L \subseteq 0^*10^*\) has no optimal proof system, then there is a polynomial time equivalent \(T \in \TALLY\), that does not possess an optimal proof system.
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{corollary}
    Let \(u : \IN \to \IN\) be a strictly increasing polynomial time function. Then there is a language \(L \in \coNTIME(2^n)\), that has no optimal proof system. Additionally, every length of a string in \(L\) is in the range of \(u\).
  \end{corollary}

  \begin{theorem}
    For every language \(L\) that possesses no optimal proof system there is a polynomial time equivalent, many-one-mitotic language, that does not possess an optimal proof system.
  \end{theorem}
