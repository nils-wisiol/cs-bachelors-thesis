\chapter{Preliminaries}
  As mentioned before, we will first introduce important symbols and definitions. Although some familiarity with standard notions of complexity theory is assumed, here we will define most of the notions used in this thesis. For the most important ones, we will give a short discussion.

  \begin{definition}[Proof system]
    A function \(f \in \FP\) is called \defNotion{proof system} for a language \(L\) if the range of \(f\) is \(L\).
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[OPT]
    Let \defNotion{\(\OPT\)} be the complexity class of all sets that have a p-optimal proof system.
  \end{definition}
