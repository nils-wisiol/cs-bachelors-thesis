  {\huge Simulation of Proof Systems} \hfill Nils Wisiol

  \vspace{3cm}
  
  \begin{definition}
    A function \(h \in \FP\) is called \defNotion{proof system} for a language \(L\) if the range of \(h\) is \(L\). A string \(w\) with \(h(w) = x\) is called an \defNotion{\(h\)-proof} for \(x\).
  \end{definition}

  With this definition, a proof system for \(L\) is basically a polynomial-time bounded function that enumerates \(L\). To give an example, let \(sat\) be defined by
    \[
       sat(x) =
       \begin{cases}
         \varphi & (x = \langle \alpha, \varphi \rangle \text{ and \(\alpha\) is an satisfying assignment for \(\varphi\)}), \\
         \perp & (\text{otherwise}). \\
       \end{cases}
    \]
  Then \(h\) is a proof system for \(\SAT\).

  Notice, in spite of its time bound against the input, the shortest proof of a string \(w \in L\) can be be very long. There may be various proof systems for a language \(L\). In order to make them comparable, we define the notion of \defNotion{simulation} of proof systems.
  
  \begin{definition}
    Let \(h\) and \(h'\) be proof systems for a language \(L\). If there is a polynomial \(p\) and a function \(f\) such that for all \(w \in \Sigma^*\)
      \[
        h(f(w)) = h'(w)
      \]
    and \(|f(w)| \leq p(|w|)\), then \(h\) \defNotion{simulates} \(h'\).
  \end{definition}

  Informally speaking, \(f\) translates \(h\)-proofs into polynomial length bounded \(h'\)-proofs. Notice, \(f\) could be hard or even impossible to calculate.

  \begin{definition}
    A proof system \(h\) for a language \(L\) is called \defNotion{optimal}, if it simulates every proof system for \(L\).
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}
    Let \defNotion{\(\OPT\)} be the complexity class of all languages that have an optimal proof system.
  \end{definition}
